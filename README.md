<h1>Baby AES Implementation and Mathematical Analysis</h1>

# Introduction:
The U.S. Government selected the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as a symmetric block cipher to safeguard classified information. It is widely used in software and hardware worldwide to secure sensitive data. Our project aims to create a version of AES known as "baby AES" to demonstrate the core concepts of the algorithm including its foundations and practical applications, in cryptography. This initiative will explore aspects of AES, such as the substitution permutation network, key schedule and the use of finite field arithmetic offering a comprehensive overview suitable, for educational purposes.

# Objectives:
1. To document the principles underlying AES, such, as finite fields (also known as Galois fields) substitution permutation networks and the structure of block ciphers.
2. To develop a version of the AES algorithm to showcase its features using a smaller block size and key length for easier comprehension and analysis.
3. To investigate the security implications of the adjustments made to create a "baby AES" and examining the balance between complexity and security.
4. To share the results and the implemented algorithm in a way that's understandable for peers, with knowledge of number theory and cryptography following academic standards and ethics.

# Methodology:
Our plan involves breaking down the AES algorithm into steps focusing on encryption and decryption. We will begin by researching to understand the theory required to create a simpler version of AES. The project includes:<br>
•	Studying the math principles relevant to AES like finite fields, substitution-permutation, etc.<br>
•	Design and Implementation of a “baby AES” in either Python or C++.<br>
•	A detailed analysis of the algorithm’s working, including key expansion, byte substitution, shifts, and mix columns.<br>
•	Comparing our version, with the standard AES to show how understanding such cryptographic standards is quite educational.<br>

# Expected Outcomes:
Upon finishing this project, our goal is to enhance our knowledge of the AES encryption process and its underlying mathematical principles. The outcomes of the project will include:
•	Implementation of a working version of "baby AES".<br>
•	A comprehensive presentation of the mathematical analysis and coding techniques involved.<br>
•	A video presentation that simplifies the intricacies of AES, suitable for academic viewers.<br>
