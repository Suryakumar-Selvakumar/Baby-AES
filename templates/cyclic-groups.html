                <p>A cyclic group is a type of group in abstract algebra, which is a set equipped with a single binary operation that satisfies four conditions: closure, associativity, the existence of an identity element, and the existence of inverse elements for each element in the set.</p>
                <p>A group is called cyclic if there exists a single element \(g\) in the group such that every other element of the group can be expressed as \(g\) raised to some integer power (in multiplicative notation) or multiplied by an integer (in additive notation). In other words, the group consists of all powers of \(g\).</p>
                <p>In a finite field like \(GF(2^n)\), which is used in AES, the non-zero elements form a cyclic group under multiplication modulo a polynomial. For AES, the polynomial is irreducible and has a degree of 8, hence the field \(GF(2^8)). In AES, several operations can be seen through the lens of cyclic groups as explained below.</p>

                    <h3>Key Expansion</h3>
                    <p>AES keys are expanded using Rijndael's key schedule, which involves a combination of byte substitution using the S-box, row shifts, and a round constant XOR operation. The round constant for each round can be considered elements of a cyclic group, where each constant is generated by multiplying the previous one by \(x\;\) \((\)in the field \(GF(2^8))\).</p>

                    <h3>ShiftRows</h3>
                    <p>The ShiftRows step in AES cyclically shifts the rows of the state; this can be seen as permuting elements within a cyclic group. Each row forms a cyclic group under the operation of shifting, and the ShiftRows step performs an operation that is essentially a cyclic permutation within each row group.</p>

                    <h3>MixColumns</h3>
                    <p>Although not immediately obvious as a cyclic group operation, the MixColumns transformation involves matrix multiplication over \(GF\)\((2^8)\) where the matrix represents a fixed polynomial. Since the non-zero elements of \(GF\)\((2^8)\) form a cyclic group under multiplication, this step is effectively carrying out cyclic group operations across the columns of the state.</p>

                    <h3>AddRoundKey</h3>
                    <p>The bitwise XOR operation used in the AddRoundKey step is a group operation in the two-element field \(GF\)\((2)\) applied across each bit position in parallel. If you consider each bit position as an independent cyclic group with two elements\(\,(0\,and\,1\,)\), then the AddRoundKey is a series of parallel group operations in these cyclic groups.</p>

                <p>The concept of cyclic groups helps to understand the algebraic structure underlying the AES operations, which is important for both implementing the cipher efficiently and analyzing its security properties. Understanding these group operations helps cryptographers ensure that the operations of AES maintain a high level of confusion and diffusionâ€”key principles in making a cipher resistant to various types of cryptographic attacks.</p>
